In all seriousness, thanks for checking it out! We hope you enjoy it. If you like the work we are doing, feel free to donate to our kickstarter! We are trying to raise a modest $1000 which will really help us get the necessary supplies we need, as well as the ability to get extra help to put content out faster. Stay tuned for more information to be released.
